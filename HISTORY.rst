- Changelog: `v0.1.19...v0.1.20 <https://github.com/rodluger/showyourwork/compare/v0.1.19...v0.1.20>`_

0.1.19 (2021-10-25)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed typo that causes Zenodo integration to fail.
- Changelog: `v0.1.18...v0.1.19 <https://github.com/rodluger/showyourwork/compare/v0.1.18...v0.1.19>`_

0.1.18 (2021-10-25)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Added more informative error messages that are displayed at the very *end* of the build logs.
  Still more work to be done on this front, but error logs should now be much easier to parse.
- Implemented the new Zenodo config structure in the ``showyourwork.yml`` file, as per
  `#31 <https://github.com/rodluger/showyourwork/issues/31>`_.
- Changelog: `v0.1.17...v0.1.18 <https://github.com/rodluger/showyourwork/compare/v0.1.17...v0.1.18>`_

0.1.17 (2021-10-22)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Changed the way Zenodo dependencies are provided in the ``showyourwork.yml`` file. Dependencies like
  datasets should still be listed as entries under the corresponding figure scripts in ``figure_dependencies``,
  but all information on how to ``generate`` or ``download`` them should now go in a separate top-level
  ``zenodo:`` key. This makes it much easier to, e.g., specify datasets used by multiple figures.
  Please see the ``Custom workflows`` section of the docs for more information.
- Improved the API documentation.
- Changelog: `v0.1.16...v0.1.17 <https://github.com/rodluger/showyourwork/compare/v0.1.16...v0.1.17>`_

0.1.16 (2021-10-22)
+++++++++++++++++++

- **Template repo update:** Pared down the ``Makefile`` in the template repository. This now calls
  a ``Makefile`` in the ``showyourwork`` submodule (this repo), which contains all the directives.
  This makes it easier to improve/update the workflow, since we can just update ``showyourwork``.
- Changelog: `v0.1.15...v0.1.16 <https://github.com/rodluger/showyourwork/compare/v0.1.15...v0.1.16>`_

0.1.15 (2021-10-21)
+++++++++++++++++++

- **Template repo update:** Added options to the ``Makefile`` to generate a report and a DAG.
  Added a submodule setup check; if the user didn't init the showyourwork submodule, does it
  automatically before building.
- Changelog: `v0.1.14...v0.1.15 <https://github.com/rodluger/showyourwork/compare/v0.1.14...v0.1.15>`_

0.1.14 (2021-10-21)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Remove duplicated Zenodo links from figure captions
- Changelog: `v0.1.13...v0.1.14 <https://github.com/rodluger/showyourwork/compare/v0.1.13...v0.1.14>`_

0.1.12 (2021-10-20)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Revert code that prevents the Snakefile from being loaded more than once. Turns out that is
  expected behavior, and is required in order for the module import syntax to work!
- Switched to adding checks within the ``zenodo.py`` script to prevent dependencies from getting
  ingested multiple times.
- Changelog: `v0.1.11...v0.1.12 <https://github.com/rodluger/showyourwork/compare/v0.1.11...v0.1.12>`_

+++++++++++++++++++

- Changelog: `v0.1.4...v0.1.5 <https://github.com/rodluger/showyourwork/compare/v0.1.4...v0.1.5>`_
